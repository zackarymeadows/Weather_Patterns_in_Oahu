# Surfs Up!
Data Analysis of temperature and precipitation in Oahu. 

### Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to compare temperature and precipitation between two months in order to justify opening a year round surf and ice cream shop. 


### Results: 
When comparing the temperatures of the month of June to the month of December, it's clear there is a very minimal difference. The average temperature for both is in the 70s.

When the precipice of the lower quartile is almost 70 degrees, we can surmise that the surfers/ice cream enjoyers will rarely be cold. 

When we observe the summary statistics of precipitation in Oahu for both months, we see low values across the board. It's comforting to see that even though the max value for precipitation in December is 6mm, the average is negligible, less then 1mm.

### Summary:
In conclusion, it would be a fantastic idea to set a surf shop/ice cream shop in a place with as temerate a climate as Oahu. 
There are a few more steps to sell this idea to the investors. 
To put the clients mind at ease, we could plot both the temperature and precipitation data in a box and whisker graph. This would show the few outliers in a simple and visual manner. We could also compare the temperature and precipitation to other cities with year round stores dependent on fair weather.
